Metalloprotein tutorial I: Rubredoxin
======================================

How to set up an MM and QM/MM model from scratch using the ASH-OpenMM interface.

**Test system:** rubredoxin

This tutorial shows how to set up a classical model of the rubredoxin metalloprotein in ASH using the CHARMM36 forcefield.
Rubredoxin is one of the simplest metalloproteins having only a single metal-ion (Fe), bound to the protein via 4 cysteine residues but that makes
the system a good first test system to demonstrate how to set up a relatively simple metalloprotein using the ASH-OpenMM interface.

The files for this tutorial can be found in the ASH source code directory under:
$ASHDIR/examples/OpenMM_Modeller-setups/rubredoxin or https://github.com/RagnarB83/ash/tree/master/examples/OpenMM_Modeller-setups/rubredoxin



######################################################
**1. Use OpenMM_Modeller to set up the system**
######################################################

We will set up a model for rubredoxin based on the `2DSX PDB file <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2DSX>`_, a 0.68 Ã… X-ray structure.
First we download the PDB-file and save it as 2dsx.pdb in our working directory.
Next we create a script (here called *1-modelsetup-bad1.py*) that looks like:

*1-modelsetup-bad1.py:*

.. code-block:: python

    from ash import *

    #Define variable pdbfile that poitns to the original raw PDB-file (no hydrogens, nosolvent)
    pdbfile="2dsx.pdb"

    # Setting up system via OpenMM_Modeller and requesting the CHARMM36 forcefield
    OpenMM_Modeller(pdbfile=pdbfile, forcefield='CHARMM36')

The script calls the OpenMM_Modeller function. See :doc:`OpenMM-interface` for details on the OpenMM_Modeller.
OpenMM_Modeller will read the unmodified PDB-file and attempt to set up the system using the CHARMM36 protein forcefield.
This script will exit with an error (from the OpenMM library), however, as OpenMM does not recognize the Fe ion in the PDB-file.

.. code-block:: text

    ValueError: No template found for residue 53 (FE).  This might mean your input topology is missing some 
        atoms or bonds, or possibly that you are using the wrong force field.

The relevant line in the PDB-file is:

.. code-block:: text

    HETATM  401 FE    FE A 501       2.866  -0.198   9.125  1.00  4.06          FE

The line indicates that atom 401 has the atomname: FE, residuename: FE, chain: A, resid: 501, followed by xyz coordinates: 2.866  -0.198   9.125), 
occupancy: 1.00, thermal factor: 4.06 and element name: FE

To fix this problem we need to modify the forcefield and make a residue definition for the Fe ion so that it matches the information in the PDB-file.

Let's create an OpenMM forcefield XML file that looks like:

*specialresidue.xml:*

.. code-block:: xml

    <ForceField>
    <AtomTypes>
    <Type name="FEX" class="Fe" element="Fe" mass="55.84700"/>
    </AtomTypes>
    <Residues>
    <Residue name="FE">
    <Atom name="FE" type="FEX"/>
    </Residue>
    </Residues>
    <NonbondedForce coulomb14scale="1.0" lj14scale="1.0">
    <Atom type="FEX" charge="0.0" sigma="1.3" epsilon="0.0"/>
    </NonbondedForce>
    <LennardJonesForce lj14scale="1.0">
    <Atom type="FEX" sigma="0.3" epsilon="0.00000"/>
    </LennardJonesForce>
    </ForceField>

This OpenMM XML file defines a forcefield associated with the Fe residue. A list of atomtypes needs to be defined (here only a single atomtype, FEX, is needed). 
Note that an atomtype can be applied to many atoms in a residue or many residues while an atomname is unique within a residue.
Then the extra residue needs to be defined (named "FE"). Next we define an atom name ("FE") that points to the atom type ("FEX").
Finally, we need to define nonbonded parameters associated with the residue and the single atom. Note that in this case we need to define both NonbondedForce and LennardJonesForce in order
to be consistent with the CHARMM36 forcefield as defined within OpenMM.


Now that we have created an XML-file (*specialresidue.xml*) associated with the Fe ion residue that OpenMM complained about, we can try to call OpenMM_Modeller again, this time telling OpenMM_Modeller about the extra forcefield file.


*1-modelsetup-bad2.py:*

.. code-block:: python

    from ash import *

    #Define variable pdbfile that poitns to the original raw PDB-file (no hydrogens, nosolvent)
    pdbfile="2dsx.pdb"

    # Setting up system via OpenMM_Modeller and requesting the CHARMM36 forcefield
    OpenMM_Modeller(pdbfile=pdbfile, forcefield='CHARMM36', extraxmlfile="specialresidue.xml")


While this script runs to completion in just a few seconds, we are not quite ready. The Fe ion is now defined in the combined forcefield, however, OpenMM does not know that the Fe ion is actually chemically bonded to 4 deprotonated cysteine
residues of the protein. Those 4 cysteine residues are Cys6, Cys9, Cys39 and Cys42.

.. image:: figures/rubredoxin-cysteines-combined-72.png
   :align: center
   :width: 700


Cysteine residues are by default assumed to have a protonated sidechain and we can see on the figure on the left that OpenMM added H-atoms to each thiol group of the cysteine sidechain.
This is obviously not what we want for our Fe ion that should be coordinated to 4 deprotonated cysteines (right figure)



In order to let OpenMM_Modeller know that we do not want those cysteine sidechains protonated we need to define 
the residue_variants keyword argument.
The residue_variants value needs to be a dictionary that points to alternative residuenames for residues with 
other protonation states.
Here we tell OpenMM_Modeller that these 4 cysteine residues should be CYX residues (deprotonated CYS).


*1-modelsetup_simple.py:*

.. code-block:: python

    from ash import *

    #Original raw PDB-file (no hydrogens, nosolvent)
    pdbfile="2dsx.pdb"

    #XML-file to deal with cofactor
    extraxmlfile="./specialresidue.xml"

    #Setting some manual protonation states. Note: ASH counts from 0
    #Here defining residues 5,8,38,41 (6,9,39,42 in the PDB-file) to be deprotonated cysteines (CYX).
    residue_variants={5:'CYX',8:'CYX',38:'CYX',41:'CYX'}

    # Setting up system via Modeller
    OpenMM_Modeller(pdbfile=pdbfile, forcefield='CHARMM36',
        extraxmlfile=extraxmlfile, residue_variants=residue_variants)



This is the final version of the setup script that will correctly setup the rubredoxin model, at least with respect to the coordinated Fe ion.
For this system

Valid alternative residue names for alternative protonation states of titratable residues:

- LYN instead of LYS: deprotonated lysine residue (NH2 instead of NH3)
- CYX instead of CYS: deprotonated cysteine residue (S- instead of SH)
- ASH instead of ASP: protonated aspartate residue (COOH instead of COO-)
- GLH instead of GLU: protonated glutamate residue (COOH instead of COO-)
- HID instead of HIS: histidine protonated at delta nitrogen
- HIE instead of HIS: histidine protonated at epsilon nitrogen

.. note:: These names can not be used in the PDB-file. Only in the residue_variants dictionary that you provide to OpenMM_Modeller.


If OpenMM_Modeller runs through the whole protocol successfully, it will print out the the following output in the end:


.. code-block:: text

    Files written to disk:
    system_afterfixes.pdb
    system_afterfixes2.pdb
    system_afterH.pdb
    system_aftersolvent.pdb
    system_afterions.pdb and finalsystem.pdb (same)

    Final files:
    finalsystem.pdb  (PDB file)
    finalsystem.ygg  (ASH fragment file)
    finalsystem.xyz   (XYZ coordinate file)
    system_full.xml   (System XML file)


    OpenMM_Modeller done! System has been fully set up

    To use this system setup to define a future OpenMMTheory object for this system you can either do:

    1. Use full system XML-file:
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlsystemfile="system_full.xml", pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb", periodic=True)

    1. Define using separate forcefield XML files:
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlfiles=["charmm36.xml", "charmm36/water.xml", "./specialresidue.xml"], pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb", periodic=True)

OpenMM_Modeller has here executed a multi-step protocol that fixes problems in the PDB-file, corrects for missing atoms, will add H-atoms according to an algorithm and takes pH into account (default pH=7.0) and finally will add a solvent box around the protein as well as ions according to a desired ion strength (here 0.1).
PDB-files are created for each step and can be inspected.


.. image:: figures/rubredoxin_setup_all72.png
   :align: center

Figure above shows a visualization of the PDB after basic fixes (missing heavy atoms added) at the top left, after adding all hydrogen atoms (top right), after adding a solvent box (bottom left) and after adding ions (bottom right).

.. note:: Even though OpenMM_Modeller exits succesfully without errors you should be highly 
    critical of the final results and visual inspection of the PDB-files will always be required. 
    Pay special attention to the environment around unusual residues and inspect the protonation states of titratable residues, 
    e.g. by analyzing hydrogen bonding networks.
    Histidine protonation states are especially important (and C/N assignments may even be wrong in the X-ray structure).

The final version of the script shows how additional options can be used to control the size of the solvation box (solvent_padding), choose watermodel, 
control protonation state of titratable residues according to pH value, change ionicstrength, positive and negative iontypes to add etc.

###############################################################
**2a. Minimize system and run a classical MD simulation**
###############################################################

Once OpenMM_Modeller has finished setting up the system we need to do some basic classical simulations to make sure 
the system is stable before attemping future QM/MM geometry optimizations or QM/MM MD system. While OpenMM_Modeller returns a valid OpenMMTheory ASH object that could be used as input in the next steps, it is often more
convenient to separate the OpenMM_Modeller setup in one script and simulations in another script. It is also required in this case because we
need to be able define bond-constraints in OpenMMTheory.

To create an OpenMMTheory object in a new script from the OpenMM_Modeller setup we canread in a list of forcefield XML files that were used in the original setup together with the PDB-file:

.. code-block:: python

    #Creating new OpenMM object from OpenMM full system file
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlfiles=["charmm36.xml", "charmm36/water.xml", "./specialresidue.xml"], pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb", periodic=True,
                platform='OpenCL', numcores=numcores, autoconstraints='HBonds', constraints=bondconstraints, rigidwater=True)

The charmm36.xml and charmm36/water.xml files should be found automatically in the OpenMM library while the specialresidue.xml file needs to be present in the directory.

Alternatively we can also read in the XML-file that OpenMM_Modeller created for the full system ("system_full.xml") together with 
the PDB-file ("finalsystem.pdb") using the xmlsystemfile= option to OpenMMTheory:



.. code-block:: python

    #Creating new OpenMM object from OpenMM full system file
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlsystemfile="system_full.xml", pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb", periodic=True, platform='OpenCL', numcores=numcores,
                        autoconstraints='HBonds', constraints=bondconstraints, rigidwater=True)

.. warning:: The xmlsystemfile="system_full.xml" option has the disadvantage that all constraints of the system have been hardcoded into the XML file and can not be changed later.
    This it not a good option for future QM/MM optimizations since these constraints are not compatible with QM/MM optimization runs (using geomeTRIC).

.. note:: pdbfile=  input in OpenMMTheory is used to define the topology and needs to match the assumed topology in the XML-files. 
    The PDB-coordinates are not used by OpenMMTheory (except to define user constraints)



To show how we can run classical simulations of our rubredoxin setup consider the script below. It should run in less than 3-5 minutes on a decent CPU or GPU.


*2a-classicalMD.py:*

.. code-block:: python

    from ash import *

    numcores=4

    #FeS4 indices (inspect finalsystem.pdb file to get atom indices). Note that ASH counts from 0.
    cofactor_indices=[96, 136, 567, 607, 755]
    bondconstraints=[[755,96],[755,136],[755,567],[755,607]]

    #Defining fragment containing coordinates (can be read from XYZ-file, ASH fragment or PDB-file)
    fragment=Fragment(pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb")

    #Creating new OpenMM object from OpenMM full system file
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlsystemfile="system_full.xml", pdbfile="finalsystem.pdb", periodic=True, platform='CPU', numcores=numcores,
                        autoconstraints='HBonds', constraints=bondconstraints, rigidwater=True)

    #MM minimization for 100 steps
    OpenMM_Opt(fragment=fragment, theory=omm, maxiter=100, tolerance=1)

    #Classical NVT MD simulation for 5 ps at 300 K
    OpenMM_MD(fragment=fragment, theory=omm, timestep=0.001, simulation_time=5, traj_frequency=10, temperature=300,
        integrator='LangevinMiddleIntegrator', coupling_frequency=1, trajectory_file_option='DCD')

    #Re-image trajectory so that protein is in middle
    MDtraj_imagetraj("trajectory.dcd", "final_MDfrag_laststep.pdb", format='DCD')


.. note:: All optimizers and MD-simulators in ASH that take an ASH fragment as input will update the coordinates of that ASH fragment
    with the coordinates of the last step.
    In the script above, the MD function will use the last geometry from the OpenMM_Opt function.


This script defines an ASH fragment from the final PDB-file created by OpenMM_Modeller. It then defines an OpenMM_Theory object using the 
full system XML file (and PDB topology). In addition to basic automatic X-H bondconstraints and rigid-water constraints we also have to
add constraints associated with the Fe-S cysteine bonds as our simple forcefield did not define bonded parameters associated with this interaction.
The bond constraints are easily defined as a list of lists using the atom indices of the Fe (755) and the sulfurs (96,136,567,607). Note that ASH counts from 0.
Alternatively, we could also have added harmonic bond restraints instead of rigid constraints.

We next provide the ASH fragment and the OpenMMTheory as input to the OpenMM_Opt minimizer and run a minimization of 100 steps.
For a large MM system it is typically not needed to minimize the whole system until convergence (and can in fact be very hard to accomplish).
Here we simply minimize for 100 steps in order to remove large forces from the system (due to the addition of H-atoms and solvent) before we
go on to perform an MM simulation.

Next we perform an MM MD simulation using OpenMM_MD. Here we do a very short MD simulation for 5 picoseconds using a timestep 
of 0.001 ps (1 fs) at 300 K. We use a Langevin integrator that also acts as thermostat and we will thus sample the NVT ensemble.

The trajectory can be visualized using VMD:

.. code-block:: shell

    vmd final_MDfrag_laststep.pdb trajectory.dcd



.. raw:: html

    <div align=center>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="_static/rubredoxin-weirdbox-720p.mov" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </div>


The trajectory or the PDB-file associated with the last snapshot (final_MDfrag_laststep.pdb) may appear quite odd as seen above with the protein
being partially outside the box and centered on one of the box corners (and then jumping between corners). It is important to realize that there is 
nothing wrong with the simulation, it's only a visualization oddity due to the periodic boundary conditions enforced during the simulation. 
If one inspects neighbouring boxes in VMD (Periodic tab in the Graphical Representations window) one can see that each protein is fully solvated 
if surrounding boxes are visualized.

.. image:: figures/rubredoxin-multibox.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

However, it is also possible to reimage the trajectory so that the protein appears more pleasingly in the center of the box as shown below (or last line in the script above)

.. code-block:: python

    MDtraj_imagetraj("trajectory.dcd", "final_MDfrag_laststep.pdb", format='DCD')

The reimaged trajectory, "trajectory_imaged.dcd",  will look like this:

###########################################################################
**2b. Run through an advanced NPT equilibration + long NVT simulation**
###########################################################################

Step 2a above only ran a very short 5 ps MD simulation and is only to demonstrate the basic principles in a short runtime.
5 ps is much too short of a simulation time to properly equilibrate a solvated protein system.
Here we will instead run through a longer multistep simulation protocol that will make sure the system is equilibrated.
We will use a 4fs timestep which is relatively large (a longer timestep allows longer simulation times but can lead to instabilities). 
Classical MD simulations in OpenMM with the LangevinMiddleIntegrator and appropriate constraints (autoconstraints='HBonds', rigidwater=True, default hydrogenmass scaling of 1.5)
can typically use such large timesteps without problems.

We will use the original files from OpenMM_Modeller, redo the 100-step minimization but then request a long NPT simulation (using the OpenMM_box_relaxation function)
that uses both a barostat that changes the box dimensions (to keep pressure constant) until the volume and density of the system reaches convergence.
Once the simulation is found to be converged, last snapshot together with the converged box vectors are used to start a long 1 ns NVT simulation.

    #Re-image trajectory so that protein is in middle
    MDtraj_imagetraj("NVTtrajectory.dcd", "final_MDfrag_laststep.pdb", format='DCD')

To test whether the system is stable during the long final NVT simulation we can do some analysis of the trajectory.

**TODO: Make plots of :**

- temperature vs. time
- RMSD vs. time
- other things vs. time
  
Note that while in principle NPT simulations are more realistic conditions than NVT, the NVT simulations have the benefit that the
periodic box vectors are constant and will not change from snapshot to snapshot, a convenient property when grabbing arbitrary snapshots from the trajectory
for other calculations.



###########################################################################
**3. Run semi-empirical GFN-xTB QM/MM MD simulation**
###########################################################################

Once we have performed an acceptable classical simulation (with the Fe-S bonds of the metal site constrained) and demonstrated that the system is stable 
we can move on to QM/MM calculations that allow a more realistic description of the metal site and allows us to remove artificial constraints associated 
with the Fe-S bonds (we constrained them because we did not have bonded MM parameters available).
Typical QM/MM calculations involved geometry optimizations of a system-subset : see step 4 below.

But here, due to the small cofactor involved and the availability of a decent cheap semi-empirical method (GFN-XTB) that can handle transition metals we can perform
GFN-xTB/CHARMM36 QM/MM MD simulations for a few picoseconds and explore the dynamic nature of the metal site properly (the accuracy of such a simulations depends 
of course how well the semi-empirical method handles the system).


.. note:: This feature is in an experimental stage as OpenMM will run with periodic boundary conditions active while the QM-theory (here xTB) does not know about
    the periodic boundary conditions and will calculate a non-periodic box instead. It's unclear how reliable this approximation is in the long run.

        integrator='LangevinMiddleIntegrator', coupling_frequency=1)


TODO: inspect QM/MM trajectory


Finally, note that we are of course not limited to semi-empirical methods for QM/MM MD.
The xTBTheory we used as QM theory can be replaced by any QM-theory implemented in ASH, including ORCATheory, allowing for a regular DFT method as QM-method instead.
This, however, will mean that each QM energy+gradient step will take longer, meaning only shorter timescales can be reached.


####################################################################################
**4. Run QM/MM geometry optimizations at the DFT-level using ORCA as QM theory**
####################################################################################

QM/MM geometry optimizations are the most typical way of running QM/MM calculations of a protein active site.
One defines a QM-region that can be chosen to be as large as one can afford and an active region that can be considerably larger (typically consisting of all QM atoms and many surrounding MM atoms, usually around 1000 atoms).
The QM-theory can then be chosen to be any QM-method within a QM-theory interface available in ASH. Note that you most certainly want the QM-method to have an analytic gradient available 
(usually the case for most DFT, HF and MP2 methods but rarer for e.g. WFT methods like CCSD(T)).

We will here run QM/MM geometry optimization using the ORCATheory interface and will choose the DFT-composite method r2SCAN-3c as our QM-level.
We will first choose a small active region that consists only of the QM-region (17 atoms + 4 linkatoms). This means that we don't have to worry too much about what happens at the MM-level since the whole MM-region is frozen and will interact
with the QM-region via electrostatic embedding (MM pointcharges polarizing the QM electron density), short-range Lennard-Jones interactions (MM atoms interacting with QM atoms via the Lennard-Jones parameters defined in the forcefield) as well 
as via the bonded terms occurring at the QM and MM boundary.

This optimization should converge in about 13 optimization steps.
geomeTRICOptimizer writes out 2 trajectory files that can be visualized: geometric_OPTtraj.xyz (active-region only) geometric_OPTtraj_Full.xyz (full system) using e.g VMD:

.. code-block:: text

    vmd geometric_OPTtraj.xyz  # visualize trajectory with active region 
    vmd geometric_OPTtraj_Full.xyz # visualize full trajectory
    vmd final_MDfrag_laststep_imaged.pdb geometric_OPTtraj_Full.xyz # visualize trajectory with topology information available

.. note:: Unlike the active-region trajectory above that shows only the QM atoms, if you inspect the ORCA inputfile created by ASH  (orca.inp by default) you will notice that the QM-coordinates provided by ASH to ORCA contain 4 extra hydrogen atoms on each carbon atom.
    These are link atoms that turn each methylene group in the QM-region into a methyl group in order to maintain a simple closed-shell electronic structure.
    The forces acting on the linkatoms are projected onto the MM atoms by ASH automatically.

While our QM/MM geometry optimization with this small active region can be an acceptable first approximation, a more realistic calculation that accounts for protein environment flexibility
is to allow a larger active region. We will here choose a large active region of ~ 1000 atoms, surrounding the metal-site. Note that while an even larger active region is of course possible,
really large active regions create minimization problems as well MM local minima problems occurring in QM/MM reaction profile studies. In order to conveniently choose the active region we can 
create a little temporary script (here called define_activeregion.py) that calls the actregiondefine function and defines a list of
atom indices of whole residues that are 12 Ã… away from the origin atom (here the Fe ion).


*define_activeregion.py:*

.. code-block:: python

    from ash import *

    #Defining fragment containing coordinates (can be read from XYZ-file, ASH fragment, PDB-file)
    lastpdbfile="final_MDfrag_laststep_imaged.pdb"
    fragment=Fragment(pdbfile=lastpdbfile)

    #Creating new OpenMM object from OpenMM XML files (built-in CHARMM36 and a user-defined one)
    omm = OpenMMTheory(xmlfiles=["charmm36.xml", "charmm36/water.xml", "./specialresidue.xml"], pdbfile=lastpdbfile, periodic=True,
                platform='CPU',  autoconstraints=None, rigidwater=False)


    #Defining active region as within X Ã… from originatom 755 (Fe)
    actregiondefine(mmtheory=omm, fragment=fragment, radius=12, originatom=755)

The script will create the following output:

.. code-block:: text

                      ###########################
                      #                         #
                    #     ActregionDefine     #
                      #                         #
                      ###########################


    Radius: 12
    Origin atom: 755 (Fe)
    Will find all atoms within 12 Ã… from atom: 755 (Fe)
    Will select all whole residues within region and export list
    Wrote list to file: active_atoms
    Active region size: 908
    Active-region indices written to file: active_atoms
    The active_atoms list  can be read-into Python script like this:	 actatoms = read_intlist_from_file("active_atoms")
    Wrote Active region XYZfile: ActiveRegion.xyz  (inspect with visualization program)


This active_atoms file just contains a list of atom indices indicating which atoms should be active (all others are frozen).
The file can be manually modified if required. The ActiveRegion.xyz file can be visualized to make sure that the active-region looks reasonable.

.. warning:: While it might be tempting to call the actregiondefine function directly within your regular ASH QM/MM optimization script, this is typically 
    not a good idea as the active region is then redefined for each set of new system coordinates. It's possible that the active region might slightly change in subsequent jobs due to e.g. water molecules being randomly in 
    or out out of the sphere-radius when the function is run. This will result in an inconsistent energy surface. Instead: run the actregion definition script only once to define the active-atoms 
    list and use for all subsequent jobs.

While we do not need to apply constraints to the X-H bonds of the protein (as is typically done in MD simulations to allow longer timesteps) we do have to make sure that the water molecules remain
rigid as they should be according to the model definition (applies to standard water forcefields like TIP3, TIP4P, SPC). Since we use the geomeTRICOptimizer here, this information
needs to be provided using the constraints keyword argument.
We use this simple code below to define a constraints dictionary that can then be passed onto the geomeTRICOptimizer.

.. code-block:: python

    actatoms = read_intlist_from_file("active_atoms")
    #Defining water constraints for atoms in the active region
    waterconlist = getwaterconstraintslist(openmmtheoryobject=omm, atomlist=actatoms, watermodel='tip3p')
    waterconstraints = {'bond': waterconlist}


Now we are ready to perform our QM/MM geometry optimization using our large active region of 908 atoms:
While the cost of each optimization cycle should remain  the same (the QM-region and QM theory level is the same as before), because 908 atoms are active instead
of 17 atoms, the minimization problem is tougher and we should expect more optimization cycles to take place.
The number of optimization cycles may be especially large since we are minimizing from and MD simulation snapshot rather than a previously optimized structure.
